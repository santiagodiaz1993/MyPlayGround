what I want to accomplish: I wanna be able to better track my overall productivity.

I use the apple reminders app as my main tool for tracking tasks. This includes personal, work
related tasks and entretainment (Podcasts, errands, work tasks, persoanl learning). Remidners 
is my app of choice for tracking progress in acomplishing goals.

--|> Design:
This is a pet project in which I wanna be able to create a weekly report that includes 
metrics for tracking my productivity. The weekly report will be emailed to my personal
gmail account on a weekly basis. There will also be a google document logging all tasks.

Components of report:
productivity:
	1. Tasks completed.
	2. New tasks assigned.
	3. burn down chart.

mobility:
	1. Maybe adding location tracking hourly that can be used in case of lost.

Stocks:
	1. There is a wrapper for robinhood. Maybe use it for reports?


-|> TOOLING:
- pyicloud  (IN USE)
Is a tool for interacting with icloud services through the web. The problem is that we 
do not have a function to get all avaliable reminders. You can only post reminders.
https://github.com/picklepete/pyicloud

- IFTT (IN USE)
Is a tool that runs on IOS and is able to get any new reminder or any completed reminder into 
another app. This can be evernote or google docs. I can let IFTTT run in my ipad (which is alwyas
hooked up to wifi and at home) log the reminders to my application of choice. This apps will get the
reminders and send the to the app of choice about every hour.

- Evernote API.  (DECIDED NOT TO USE)
This api seems complex to use and not very well supported. Its on beta for python3
https://dev.evernote.com/doc/start/python.php
https://github.com/evernote/evernote-sdk-python3

- Google Docs API. (IN USE)
My top option. The API is well documented plus easy to integrate with gmails API.
https://developers.google.com/docs/api

- Google gmail API.(IN USE) 
My top option for sending the report to my personal account. API is well 
supported and documented.
https://developers.google.com/gmail/api

- Robinhood wrapper. (Not sure yet)
https://github.com/robinhood-unofficial/pyrh (can be dangerouse bc of security)

- Crontab (Linux). (IN USE)


-|> Questions to be answered.
How are we gonna be checking for new and completed reminders? ANS: There is a module for this 
the module is called reports. 
https://pypi.org/project/reports/
What is the report going to include? exiting? only new? only completed?
How am I going to make sure that the job runs when the machine is off?


-|> Looking a tool to generate the report on. I have a few options:
- Generate the reports manually with .txt templates that I can slice.
- difflib is a module for diffing and generating reports. This might be useful for quickly diffing the 
document.
- creating a log of files that stores weekly changes.
- Another way to pull out new tasks is by date.

May 5 2020
1. I was able to get already the reminders out through IFTTT to a google document
2. I was able to access the list of new and completed reminders through the google doc
API
3. I was able to send an email through the gmail API.

May 6 2020
1. I was able to put the gmail api and document api into different mudles that get imported 
into the main file.

May 7 2020
1. I was able to create a queu of reminders that will go into the document. Then they will get log into a document, and the other reminders
will get used for the report.

May 8 2020
1. I was able to break the reminders into a lists.

May 9 2020

May 19 2020
1. I finished implementing all of the features of the program. Now I its unit testing
I have 4 unit tests.
2. I wanna make sure that I start adding some logging features to the appplication
3. 4/9 functions are no using unit tests

May 20 2020 
1. Refactor the all of the functions and made them into a class

################### THINGS TO LEARN ##############################################

1. I tried deleting the file but did not remember I use the unique key to acccess it. Deleting the file would allow me 
to know the new reminers that were created in the past week -- not a very nice solution. This did not work because 
everytime there would be a new file created it would have a new key. Remember to step through the process step by step.
This will help you forecast issues. A lot of time was kinda wasted with this.

2. Be careful when reasearching. So I wanted was looking for solutions to be able to to classify the newly created reminders.
I looked into the opstions in IFTTT to see if I could add the completions date -- I had only seen the ceation date. I did not 
find completion date but I did not realize that I was looking in the IFTTT configuration of the newly created reminders. The 
configuration for completed tasks HAS the option to add the completion date. Remember to be careful and use comparison as to 
find answers to questions.

3. When stuck look for ways to break the tasks into the smaller peaces. Work myself backwards on steps. In debugging mode 
DO NOT THINK END TO END!. Break the flow and test individually to be able to pin point the issue.


4. Learning how to log. There are 4 types of loggings levels that can be done:
    debug 
    info 
    warnning 
    error 
    critical
    Usually these levels have a number that represents them and they chance by a factor of 10.
